    Simplest basic code structure implementing the Petri net
    functionality. The class PetriNet is used here as namespace
    only. The code pattern demonstrated here can not be used for
    running multiple instances of the same model with different states
    of their markings. So, itâ€™s essentially a pattern for creating a
    single Petri net model. All arcs have a weight of 1.
